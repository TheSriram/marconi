"""Bootstrap for self-hosting a Marconi node

Alternatively, to host a WSGI app with an external server, configure
bootstrap with the WSGI transport and export the WSGI app callable, e.g.:

    logging.config.fileConfig(logging_conf_file)
    boot = Bootstrap(conf_file)

    app = boot.transport.app
